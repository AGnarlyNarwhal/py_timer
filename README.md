#py_timer

This is a super simple, and poorly written timer for the command line. I've only tested it in gnome-terminal and only on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS at that. I needed a timer when I didn't have internet access, and so I wrote this. 

So, it may work for you, it may not.

The only reason I uploaded it is because I may want it on some of my other computers.

It's not even really accurate, since it uses time.sleep(#) to count out the seconds.

So please, find something better if you need anything more than a bare bones timer.
